# Instructions:
1. Download both scripts to the USB drive that will be distributed to end users by copying and pasting them to a text file with the same name. No need to place them in a folder.
 
 **You can also download the entire repository as a zip file but that will download more than you need in some cases.**
2. Run 0-run-hhl-backup.bat as the user, menaing do not run as admin.
3. Press B (Backup) or R (Restore) depending on the task.
4. Notify Michael if there are any issues.

# Reason:
This is done this way so we do not enable powershell script execution on the systems. It poses a security risk and is best left disabled unless necessary.
